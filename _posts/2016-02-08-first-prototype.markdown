### Summary

This post discusses the methods used to create the first prototype melody 
completion. A summary of the key points of this post are given here:

### Method

As mentioned in the previous post, the method being used for this first 
attempt will be an artifical neural network (ANN). This particular model is 
based off of the algorithm described in *A Connectionist Approach to 
Algorithmic Composition* by Peter M. Todd, 1989. This particular model uses a 
network that is primarily feedforward, but also contains connections from the 
output layer to a subsection of the input layer.
